# Android Filter
A Progressive Web Application made with Angular 2 & Love. 

## Why?
The main reason of this app is LEARNING. I was curious about PWAs and Angular (I've learned a bit of Angular 1 in the past), nothing better than see them closer!

## What?
With the self explanatory name, this application was made with the goal of filter trash and poor apps that Google Play has. Also, should be nice say that all apps in this list was formed based in my opinion, I'm not the better person to say what's good or bad.

## How?
How I've said at first, I've used Angular 2 and Bulma CSS Framework (and I hate CSS frameworks). I'm not an expert of Angular 2 because I use Vue.js and React more often, but why not try?

Soon I'll make an tree of the folders that I have here.
